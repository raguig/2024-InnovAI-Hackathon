# About The project
Our project is a robot that can be controlled by voice commands, specifically using Moroccan Darija. This innovative robot responds to human words, allowing for seamless and intuitive interaction.
Choosing this language comes from our hope to see our country someday as a leader in AI, and we assume that this is the first step to start with.
